My research interests focus on the relationship between political identities and parties, movements and other organizations in Latin America.\n\nI am a member of the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Center (LACSC) as well as of the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Computational Social Science (iLCSS).\n\nBefore joining the graduate program at GVPT, I worked as a researcher at the Instituto de Estudios Democráticos at Panama's Electoral Tribunal.
